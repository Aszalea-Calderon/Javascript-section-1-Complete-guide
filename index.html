          <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a
            <a
              href="#"
              data-text="That means that code is not pre-compiled but instead evaluated, compiled
            and executed at runtime (e.g. when the browser executes the script)."
              class="info-modal"
            >
              dynamic, interpreted</a
            >
            and
            <a
              href="#"
              data-text=" Weakly typed languages assign types (like 'number') to variables (data
            containers) at runtime - i.e. you (the developer) can't set the types
            you want to use in certain places in advance. Only indirectly by making
            sure you're always working with the correct values."
              class="info-modal"
              >weakly typed</a
            >
            programming language which was built with the purpose of running in
            host environments (e.g. inside of a webpage in the browser).
          </p>
          <p>
            It's part of pretty much any page you visit in the web as it's the
            only "thing" in web development that allows you (= the developer) to
            change something on the page at runtime. Basically everytime
            something opens, closes, moves or changes on a webpage, JavaScript
            will be involved.
          </p>
          <p>
            There also a lot of webpages which are almost entirely powered by
            JavaScript (i.e. where a lot of the rendering work happens in the
            browser) - those pages typically use frameworks like Angular, but
            that's a topic we'll cover later in the course. :-)

          <h2>What will you learn in this Course?</h2>
          <p>
            This course teaches JavaScript from the ground up - no prior
            JavaScript knowledge is required.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll dive into all the basics and core concepts as well as advanced
            features and patterns all the way up to expert concepts and topics.
          </p>

            complete overview of the topics covered!

          developer and 5-star rated instructor on Udemy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love sharing my knowledge, not only in

            >all my courses</a

        </p>
        <p>
          I'm extremely excited to have you on board of this course - so let's
          dive right in! :-)
          Using Course Resources
This is a video-on-demand course, so information is of course conveyed via videos.

But this does not mean that you only get videos!

Instead, you find plenty of useful additional course resources which you absolutely should utilize as well!

To be precise, you'll find these kind of resources in the course:

Course Source Code:

All code that we write is attached to multiple lectures per module (= a snapshot of the code we wrote up to that lecture) and always attached to the last lecture of each module (all snapshots for that module and the final code)

Extra Information / Text Lectures: 

The vast majority of the course lectures are video lectures - but occasionally, you'll find a text lecture with some extra information here and there. These extra lectures (which are part of the regular course flow) provide some extra information that is "nice to have" or which is simply easier to refer to in written form

Course Slides:

The focus of this course is on writing code but some theoretical foundations are best set via slides. All crucial slides are attached to the lectures in which they are shown.

External Links: 

From time to time I also link to some external resources (I do mention it in the video then, you also will often find some extra, optional links at the end of each module, in the last lecture). Going through these resources is of course not required but might be helpful to dive deeper or explore certain niche or highly advanced concepts a bit close
